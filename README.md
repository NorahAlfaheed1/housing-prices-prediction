# Housing Prices Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting housing prices using data mining and
machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze the factors that influence
house prices and build predictive models to support informed decision-making.

## Dataset
The dataset is organized as follows:

- `Dataset/Original_dataset.csv`  
  The original housing dataset before preprocessing.

- `Dataset/HousingProcessed.csv`  
  The cleaned and processed dataset used for modeling.

The dataset includes features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms,
parking, location-related attributes, and furnishing status.

## Notebook
The main implementation of data preprocessing, analysis, and modeling is
provided in:

- `Housing prices prediction.ipynb`

> Note: If the notebook does not render correctly on GitHub, please download it
> and open it locally using Jupyter Notebook to view all outputs and visualizations.

## Workflow
- Data exploration and visualization
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature encoding and normalization
- Classification using Decision Tree (Gini & Entropy)
- Clustering using K-Means
- Model evaluation and comparison

## Reports and Documentation
Detailed documentation and results are available in the `Reports/` folder:
- Final project report
- Presentation slides

These files summarize the methodology, experiments, and findings of the project.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
